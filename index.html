        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Bhakti and I'm a front-end developer and a fresher in web development. I'm passionate about creating elegant, user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems.

            I specialize in Html, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, and have experience with a wide range of tools and frameworks, including Redux, Express, and MongoDB. I love collaborating with other developers and designers to create beautiful, responsive web apps that provide a great user experience.
            
            When I'm not coding, you can usually find me hiking in the mountains or playing guitar in my band. I'm also passionate about using my skills to give back to my community, and I regularly volunteer with local nonprofits to build websites and web applications that help them reach their goals.
            
            I'm currently pursuing my Third Year of  engineering from Pune University with a degree in Computer Science, and have completed a number of online courses and certifications to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices.
            
            I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and to work on projects that make a positive impact in the world. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!</p>
